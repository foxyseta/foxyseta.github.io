\opening{To J.H.,}
I am not in love with you either. You know Iâ€™m way too self-obsessed for that. I
just liked the idea of a bilingual fling is all. That and the fact you were
pretty nice to me, but that's pretty much it. You once told me that, in your
opinion, people from the US tend to come off as more polite just because they
never really say things to your face. Well, I don't know about everyone else,
but that certainly applies to you.
\closing{Sorry,}
\end{letter}
